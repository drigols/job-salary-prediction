In the top 50 Hotels in the UK, this Senior Sous Chef position is a real responsibility, so I am only looking for the strongest of candidates with a natural leadership, but still happy to take orders and learn from a senior chef. If you are serious about your food, love classical British menus with a modern twist and have what it takes to work alongside the best, creating the best then email to apply and get that job you've dreamt of for so long.

You will frequently work opposite shifts to the manager, and run the pub in the manager's absence, so the skill sets needed are broadly the same. You won't carry the full weight of responsibility for the wellbeing of the business, but you will be the manager's righthand person, and will be a senior member of the management team, making decisions and directing things on a daily basis. You'll need to understand and love pubs, take real pleasure in making people happy and play a full role in keeping the business profitable, the crew happy and the customers coming back for more. Being a deputy manager is an ideal opportunity to gain knowledge and experience of every aspect of pub life. We see our deputy managers as our managers of the future, and try to promote from within whenever we can. Our rate of growth means that there are exciting opportunities springing up all the time, and you will be able to develop your career at a pace that is appropriate to you.
