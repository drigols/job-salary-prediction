    " - Temos um grande conjunto de dados para trabalharmos:\n",
    "   - Com 244.768 amostras e 12 colunas (atributos/campos/features).\n",

    "   - O menor salário de todos (anualmente) foi de 5.000;\n",
    "   - O maior salário de todos (anualmente) foi de 200.000;\n",

    "   - A mediana (median/2° Quartil = 50% dos dados) de todos os salários (anualmente) foi de 30.000:\n",
    "     - Vejam que a nossa mediana não está tão distante da nossa média.\n",
    "   - O Desvio Padrão (Standard Deviation/ que representa quão longe nós estamos da média) é 17.640.\n",
